---

{{< include /docs/includes/_badges.qmd >}}

This is a template for creating a new [Data
Package](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-frictionless-data/)
following the Seedcase structure. Use this template to quickly get
started with a new Data Package with all the necessary files and
configurations in place, including for developing the Data Package.

## Features

-   Use [uv](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-uv/) to manage
    the Data Package.
-   Use [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) for data manipulation.
-   Use [Seedcase Sprout](https://sprout.seedcase-project.org/) to
    create and modify the Data Package.
-   Build management with [justfile](https://just.systems/man/en/).
-   Check typos with [typos](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos).
-   Code formatting and linting with
    [ruff](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-ruff/).
-   Pre-commit hooks with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
-   GitHub workflows for automatically adding Pull Requests and Issues
    to a project board.
-   Pull Request template for easy creation of new Pull Requests.
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings commonly used by
    contributors working in VS Code.

    settings for contributors.

    citation information.

-   Folder and file structure that mimics a Python package to take
    advantage of Python's packaging ecosystem.
-   [`pyproject.toml`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) for tracking
    dependencies and project metadata.
-   Use [MIT
    License](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-mit-license/)
    for the code used in the Data Package made from this template.
