This guide provides an overview of how to use this template for creating
a new Data Package. It includes instructions for using the template and
post-creation tasks.

## Installing

In order to use this template, you need to install a few programs:

-   [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#quick-start): A
    template tool for making new projects in a standardised and
    structured way.

If you use [`pipx`](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/)---which we
strongly recommend---you can install everything with the following
command:

``` bash
pipx install copier
```

## Using this template

When you are ready to create a new Data Package, you can use this
template to set up the initial structure and files. First, open a
Terminal and move into the directory where you want to create the new
Data Package. Then run the following command:

``` bash
# Copy into the current directory with "."
uvx copier copy gh:seedcase-project/template-data-package .
```

## Post-creation setup

These steps are mainly for us in the Seedcase Project to set up the
repository with the settings we use, but you can follow them if you want
to set up your Data Package in a similar way.

Install [`spaid`](https://github.com/seedcase-project/spaid) and use the
following commands to run the next setup steps:

``` bash
spaid_gh_create_repo_from_local -h
spaid_gh_set_repo_settings -h
spaid_gh_ruleset_basic_protect_main -h
```

Some configuration is needed after copying this template to a new
repository, including configuration external to the repository.

-   The template file `.github/workflows/release-package.yml` requires
    installing the
    [auto-release-token](https://github.com/apps/auto-release-token)
    GitHub App to be installed, as well as a GitHub secret called
    `UPDATE_VERSION_TOKEN` and a variable called `UPDATE_VERSION_APP_ID`
    to be set up in the repository (or organization) settings. See this
    [guide](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/operations/security#using-github-apps-to-generate-tokens)
    for more details on how to set this up.
